# QGEL - Quantum Graph Extended Library

QGEL is a general-purpose quantum graph library. It offers tools to visualize, interpret, simulate and work with graphs using quantum technology.

Built upon Qiskit, Matplotlib and NetworkX, QGEL aims to be a single-point and simple (as much as quantum computing can be) extensive library, meaning that all work envolving graphs can be done using only the functions provided by it, without the need for external tools.
